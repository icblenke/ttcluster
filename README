= Tokyo Tyrant Cluster

Tokyo Tyrant is a network interface to the Tokyo Cabinet DBM.
It provides replication by means of cmdline parameters.
You have to remember and type long command to start HA DBM servers.

This is a simple administration tool for Tokyo Tyrant clusters.
Just setup a pair of host:port and start.
You have a replicated DBM cluster running.


== How to install

Install the required packages of Tokyo Tyrant and Tokyo Cabinet.

Build a ttcluster gem package and install.

  $ gem build ttcluster.gemspec
  $ sudo gem install ttcluster-*.gem -l


== Tutorial

First, create a base directory.

  $ mkdir ~/ttcluster # -d default value

Then, setup a pair of replicated Tokyo Tyrant servers.

  $ ttcluster setup localhost:2008 localhost:2009 # server 2008, master 2009
  $ ttcluster setup localhost:2009 localhost:2008 # server 2009, master 2008

Check if the configuration of pair servers is valid.

  $ ttcluster config # the master of the master of a server is the original server

Start all servers and you have replicated DBM servers.

  $ ttcluster start  # default to 'all'

Control servers and play around.

  $ ttcluster stop 2008                     # down 2008
  $ ttcluster status                        # only 2009 is alive
  $ tcrmgr put -port 2009 localhost foo bar # add 'foo' key on 2009
  $ ttcluster start 2008                    # up 2008 and automatically replicated
  $ tcrmgr get -port 2008 -pv localhost foo # see if 2008 has 'foo' key

Use help option for other commands.

  $ ttcluster --help
